    documentation="Estilo de Integración. Communications backbone. Messaging — Have each application connect to a common messaging system, and exchange data and invoke behavior using messages.&#xA;&#xA;Communications Backbone — As more and more of an enterprise’s applications connect to the messaging system and make their functionality available through messaging, the messaging system becomes a centeralized point of one-stop-shopping for functionality in the enterprise. A new application simply needs to know which channels to use to request functionality and which others to listen on for the results. The messaging system itself essentially becomes a Message Bus, a backbone providing access to all of the enterprise’s various and ever-changing applications and functionality. You can achieve this integration nirvana more quickly and easily by specifically designing for it from the beginning."/>
